In just a few steps, this Quickstart guide shows you how to get started with Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). 

## Create a WCS account

1. Go the [WCS homepage](https://console.weaviate.cloud).
1. Click, "Create an account".
1. Provide an email address and password. 
1. After you confirm your email address, return to the login page.
1. Log in to the WCS console.

## Create a Weaviate Cluster

The WCS console start page has tools to help you manage your WCS account. 

When you log into the WCS web console, the Dashboard tab lists your clusters. There are no clusters when you log in to a new account.

Follow these steps to create a cluster.

1. Click the "Create cluster" button.
1. Select the "Free sandbox" tab. 
1. Give your cluster a name. WCS adds a suffix to ensure uniqueness.
1. Verify that "Enable Authentication?" is set to "Yes".
1. Click create.

It takes a minute or two to create the new cluster. When the cluster is ready, WCS displays a check mark (`✔️`) next to the cluster name.

The process is similar to create a managed cluster. However, you have to add your billing details first.

#### Explore the Details panel

The Details panel lists cluster metrics, authorization details, and other useful information. To access your cluster, you need the cluster URL and authentication details. 

Follow these steps to get the information.

1. Click <kbd>Details</kbd> to see them.

For the Weaviate API key, click on the <kbd>API keys <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i></kbd> button.

import SandBoxExpiry from '/_includes/sandbox.expiry.mdx';

<SandBoxExpiry/>

In the meantime, let's start installing a client library.

## Install a client library

We suggest using a [Weaviate client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md). To install your preferred client <i class="fa-solid fa-down"></i>:

import ClientCapabilitiesOverview from '/_includes/client.capabilities.mdx'

<ClientCapabilitiesOverview />

Install your preferred client by following the relevant instructions below:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart/clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

## Connect to your WCS instance

By now, you should have:
* Set up a sandbox instance of Weaviate on WCS, and
* Installed a Weaviate client library.

From the <kbd>Details</kbd> tab in WCS, get:
- The Weaviate **API key**, and
- The Weaviate **URL**.

Replace the endpoint address and API key in the following code with your address and key, then run the code for your preferred client:

import WCSClientInstantiation from '/_includes/code/wcs.client.instantiation.mdx';

<WCSClientInstantiation/>

You should receive a response containing the current schema, confirming the server is ready.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a cloud-based vector database with WCS.

## Next

Now that you are set up with a WCS instance:
* If you are new to Weaviate at large, we recommend moving to the [Weaviate Quickstart Tutorial](../weaviate/quickstart/index.md).
* Otherwise, we hope you enjoy your experience with WCS.
