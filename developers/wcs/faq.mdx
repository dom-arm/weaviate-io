## Frequently asked questions

### Accounts

#### Can I reset or change my account password?

Yes, go the [WCS login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) and click the "Log in" button. Then, click "Forgot Password" and enter your email address on the next screen.

### Sandboxes

#### When do sandboxes expire?

Sandboxes expire in 14 days.

#### How can I preserve my sandbox data?

To preserve your sandbox data, use the [cursor API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects#exhaustive-listing-using-a-cursor-after) to retrieve a copy.

To preserve your data and upgrade to a paid instance, [contact us](/pricing#contact-sales) for help.

#### How many objects can a sandbox hold?

There is no limit on the number of objects. However, sandbox performance may be limited for larger workloads.

### Instance management

#### Are WCS clusters backed up?

WCS has automated, daily backups. WCS also backs up your data before updating the version of Weaviate running on your cluster.

#### Can WCS clusters be updated to newer versions of Weaviate?

Yes. Click the "Details" button for your cluster. If a new version is available, click the "Update!" button when you have a suitable maintenance window. The button is only visible when there is a newer version available. 

#### Are cluster resources scaled automatically?

Not currently. Clusters are provisioned for common usage scenarios. WCS monitors each instance to determine when a cluster needs to be resized.

#### Can I request more cluster resources?

Possibly. If you want to customize your cluster provisioning, contact our support team to discuss possible solutions.

### Infrastructure

#### What infrastructure does WCS run on?

WCS runs in Google Cloud (GCP). Amazon Web services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are on our roadmap.

### WCS Console

#### Does the WCS console collect data from users?

The console never collects any data from your Weaviate instance; you can safely connect every instance, also over VPN.

#### Can the WCS console connect to non-WCS instances?

Yes, the WCS console can connect to a Weaviate instance regardless of whether it is a WCS instance or not.

## Account Troubleshooting

### Password reset

You can reset your password if you forgot it, or simply want to change it. To do so, navigate to the WCS login page and click <kbd>Forgot Password</kbd>.

### Where is my verification email?

If you did not receive a verification email, please check your spam folder. If you still cannot find it, you can try again using the same steps as the [password reset](#password-reset).
